# Monitoring System

This document provides an overview of the monitoring capabilities of our system, including API monitoring, load monitoring, and performance monitoring.

## API Monitoring

Monitor the health and performance of your APIs with the following metrics:

- **Response times**: Measure the time taken to respond to API requests.
    - *Example*: Average response time for `/api/v1/users` is 120ms.
- **Success/error rates**: Track the ratio of successful responses to errors.
    - *Example*: Success rate of 99.5% for `/api/v1/orders`.
- **Endpoint usage**: Analyze the frequency of API endpoint usage.
    - *Example*: `/api/v1/products` endpoint is hit 500 times per hour.
- **API errors**: Identify and log errors occurring in API calls.
    - *Example*: 404 errors for `/api/v1/nonexistent`.

## Load Monitoring

Ensure your system can handle the load with these metrics:

- **Request rates**: Monitor the number of requests per second.
    - *Example*: 1000 requests per second during peak hours.
- **Active requests**: Track the number of active requests being processed.
    - *Example*: 50 active requests at any given time.
- **Resource usage**: Measure the usage of system resources like memory and CPU.
    - *Example*: 70% CPU usage during high traffic.
- **Queue sizes**: Monitor the size of request queues.
    - *Example*: Queue size of 20 during peak load.

## Performance Monitoring

Optimize the performance of your system with these metrics:

- **Memory usage**: Track the amount of memory being used.
    - *Example*: 2GB of memory used by the application.
- **CPU usage**: Monitor the CPU usage of your system.
    - *Example*: 50% CPU usage on average.
- **Latency metrics**: Measure the delay in processing requests.
    - *Example*: Average latency of 200ms for database queries.
- **Resource utilization**: Analyze the overall utilization of system resources.
    - *Example*: 80% disk I/O utilization during backups.

By monitoring these metrics, you can ensure the reliability, efficiency, and performance of your system.
